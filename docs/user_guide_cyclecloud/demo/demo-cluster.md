## Step by Step Instructions to Build a Demo CycleCloud.  

CycleCloud itself is installed as an application server on a VM in Azure that requires outbound access to Azure Resource Provider APIs. CycleCloud then starts and manages VMs that form the HPC systems â€” these typically consist of the HPC scheduler head node(s) and compute nodes.

Follow these quickstart instructions to create CycleCloud.

Note, I could not get the above instructions to work. I had to follow the isnstructions from Rob, which was to create a VM and then from that VM create a cycle cloud instance.
I need to review both sets of instructions again to see if I can figure out the disconnect.

The goal is for users to get started and make sure they can spin up a node, launch the CycleCloud and terminate it.
