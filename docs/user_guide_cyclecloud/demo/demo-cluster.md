## Sign up for a Developer Azure Support Plan

New accounts may be restricted to what virtual machines can be created by quota.
If you have a pay-as-you go account or a free account, you need to sign up for the $29.99 per month support account in order to create a support request to increase the quota limit for the HC44rs or the HBv120 machines that are used in this tutorial.

## Request a quota increase for the HTC Queue - HC Family of vCPUs

From the Azure Portal, search for quotas, select the Quotas Service.
Click on Compute.

Use the Search Box to search for HC.
Select the HC Standard Family vCPUs in the region nearest to your location. (For North Carolina select - East US2) by clicking on the check box to the left of that selection.

Click on Request quota increase > Select Enter a new limit.
In the sidebar menu on the righ hand side, enter 44 in the text box under new limit.

## Request a quota increase for the HPC Queue - HBv3 Family of vCPUs

From the Azure Portal, search for quotas, select the Quotas Service.
Click on Compute.

Use the Search Box to search for HB
Select the HBv3 Family vCPUs in the region nearest to your location. (For North Carolina select - East US2) by clicking on the check box to the left of that selection.

Click on Request quota increase > Select Enter a new limit.
In the sidebar menu on the righ hand side, enter 120 in the text box under new limit.

## Request a quota increase for the scheduler node   D4s_v3

From the Azure Portal, search for quotas, select the Quotas Service.
Click on Compute.

Use the Search Box to search for Dv3
Select the Standard Dv3 Family vCPUs in the region nearest to your location. (For North Carolina select - East US2) by clicking on the check box to the left of that selection.

Click on Request quota increase > Select Enter a new limit.
In the sidebar menu on the righ hand side, enter 4 in the text box under new limit to request an increase in the quota to 4 vcpu.


## Request a quota increase for the F2sV2 HTC Compute Node (part of the Fsv2-series instances)


From the Azure Portal, search for quotas, select the Quotas Service.
Click on Compute.

Use the Search Box to search for 
Select the HBv3 Family vCPUs in the region nearest to your location. (For North Carolina select - East US2) by clicking on the check box to the left of that selection.

## Introduction to CycleCloud.  

CycleCloud itself is installed as an application server on a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure that requires outbound access to Azure Resource Provider APIs. CycleCloud then starts and manages VMs that form the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems â€” these typically consist of the HPC scheduler head node(s) and compute nodes.

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cyclecloud/?view=cyclecloud-8">Azure CycleCloud Documentation</a>

Create an Virtual Machine for the CycleCloud 8.2 Image and then from that VM configure a cycle cloud instance which will create a Cycle Cloud Scheduler. Use your credentials to ssh into the scheduler. 

Follow these quickstart instructions to create CycleCloud.

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cyclecloud/qs-install-marketplace?view=cyclecloud-8">Quickstart CycleCloud from Marketplace VM</a>

The goal is for users to get started and make sure they can spin up a node, launch the CycleCloud and terminate it.

Follow the instructions provided in the following link to create a managed identity.  This is the recommended practice versus using an application ID.

### Follow the instructions in the link below to increase your vCPU quota before attempting to run large-scale workloads.

### Request access to virtual machines that are not available by default.

HB-120 are not available by default, but you can request them. This tutorial was developed using UNC's enterprise account.  It is unknown if Azure will grant access to these virtual machines on a credit card account.
