## Introduction to CycleCloud.  

CycleCloud itself is installed as an application server on a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure that requires outbound access to Azure Resource Provider APIs. CycleCloud then starts and manages VMs that form the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems â€” these typically consist of the HPC scheduler head node(s) and compute nodes.

Create an Virtual Machine for the CycleCloud 8.2 Image and then from that VM configure a cycle cloud instance which will create a Cycle Cloud Scheduler. Use your credentials to ssh into the scheduler. 

Follow these quickstart instructions to create CycleCloud.

The goal is for users to get started and make sure they can spin up a node, launch the CycleCloud and terminate it.

Follow the instructions provided in the following link to create a managed identity.  This is the recommended practice versus using an application ID.

### Request access to virtual machines that are not available by default.

HB-120 are not available by default, but you can request them. This tutorial was developed using UNC's enterprise account.  It is unknown if Azure will grant access to these virtual machines on a credit card account.
