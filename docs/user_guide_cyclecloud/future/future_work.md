# List of ideas for future work

<b>Azure Cycle Cloud</b>

1. Test creation of Cycle Cloud on new account to verify instructions for user account permission settings and cycle cloud options to login, build and run CMAQ.
2. Figure out how to install slurm scheduler on AlmaLinux Virtual machine for HBv120. Determine if there is an overhead cost or penalty for running jobs within slurm versus interactively.
3. Figure out how to streamline install scripts and have them load while the Virtual Machine or Cycle Cloud instance is procurred.
4. Figure out how to save the machine image with the software installed and re-use for the creation of a new Virtual Machine.
5. Learn how to set alarms or alerts or automatic shut-down of Virtual Machine if costs exceed budget.
6. Learn how to use spot instances for running CMAQ for both a single Virtual Machine and also for the compute nodes in Cycle Cloud. I ran into difficulty using a spot node machine for the Cycle Cloud VM Application Server. (it may make it difficult to terminate the Cycle Cloud)

<b>Documentation</b>

1. Finalize documentation and implement a version for the documentation in github.
2. Learn how to use the Cost Explorer in Azure and create screenshots showing costs for the single Virtual Machine HBv120 benchmarks and also for the Azure Cycle Cloud.
