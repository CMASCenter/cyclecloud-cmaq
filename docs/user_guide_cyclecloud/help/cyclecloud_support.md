CycleCloud itself is installed as an application server on a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure that requires outbound access to Azure Resource Provider APIs. CycleCloud then starts and manages VMs that form the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems â€” these typically consist of the HPC scheduler head node(s) and compute nodes.

Create an Virtual Machine for the CycleCloud 8.2 Image and then from that VM configure a cycle cloud host instance which will create a Cycle Cloud Scheduler. Use your credentials to ssh into the scheduler.

Follow these quickstart instructions to create CycleCloud.
